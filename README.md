# Database Persistance

## Introduction

>This application allows abstraction away from manually coding in Java with the SQL database. It provides methods to call for easy ways to do CRUD operations with the database. It also implements transactions, connection pooling and ehCache for caching our database queries. It also includes multithreading support for executing queries.

## Installation

> In order to execute the methods, you will simple need to add your connection to the database in the JDBC/connection.java with the URI, username, and password
